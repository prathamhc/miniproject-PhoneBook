# **PhoneBook**

## Description
I am so excited to share with you my first year mini project: PhoneBook! PhoneBook is a management system project that I developed using C programming language. It allows you to store, search, update and delete contact information of your friends, family and colleagues.
You can also sort the contacts by name, phone number or email address. PhoneBook is a simple but useful application that demonstrates my skills and knowledge in C programming. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it! PhoneBook is a simple and user-friendly program that uses file handling techniques. PhoneBook is easy to use and reliable, and it will save you time and hassle.
